                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello World, welcome to my humble website. This will be used to improve my skills and showcase any projects I will take upon myself. I am a student at Burton and South Derbyshire College, doing a Level 3 course in Networking and Cybersecurity. However, I have taken upon myself the challenge of completing a CCNA course and a wide variety of CISCO certified qualifications. I have a keen interest in the dynamic and evolving field of cybersecurity as well as business, and I strive to become a professional in the domain. I have a strong leadership mindset and never back down from any challenge thrown my way. I am also bilingual, I am fluent in both Romanian and English. I also have a great passion for working out!</p>

                <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                <p>In the Summer of 2023, I volunteered at the YMCA for one week, which taught me how to work in the retail industry.
                    I possess strong sales skills and extensive customer service experience, which have been instrumental in achieving high customer satisfaction and driving sales growth. My proficiency in warehouse management includes overseeing inventory, ensuring efficient stock control, and maintaining a well-organized warehouse environment. My excellent communication abilities and teamwork skills have been pivotal in my leadership roles, where I have successfully led teams to meet and exceed targets.
                    Having previously worked with Curry’s PC World systems, I am well-versed in their operational processes and software, which allows for a seamless transition into the role. I have first-hand experience managing and overseeing warehouse operations independently, demonstrating my ability to handle responsibilities and make critical decisions. I am effective both on the shop floor, where I engage with customers and drive sales, and in the warehouse, where I ensure smooth logistics and timely deliveries. My solid background in handling deliveries includes coordinating with suppliers, managing schedules, and ensuring accurate and timely receipt of goods.
                    To fulfil the requirements of my college, I did a week of work experience for Greene King at their Support Centre. This taught me a variety of skills and provided exposure to the kind of job I would be interested in doing in the future. While at Greene King, I was introduced to every aspect of the business:</p>

<ul>
    <li>IT Security – This consisted of taking a look at all the different layers of security measures the company had in place.</li>
    <li>RAS (Retail Application Software) – In this, I was shown different systems the pubs use to log problems, for example, PQS (Pub Query System).</li>
    <li>21-Day Check – This draws the attention of the company to computers that haven’t been active for 21+ days and gets the RAS team to focus and see why they're turned off.</li>
    <li>IT Service Desk – General business problem-solving.</li>
    <li>Tills – This consisted of the systems behind the tills and menu building.</li>
    <li>Away day – I was taken along to a meeting between other sections of the business to discuss upcoming changes and improvements to the pubs and hotels.</li>
    <li>Infrastructure – This was made up of being shown their data centre, their backup systems, and risk prevention.</li>
</ul>
